# Rick and Morty Platform - Deployment Updates

## Files that need to be updated for the "Add Episode" feature:

### 1. Create: client/src/components/add-episode-modal.tsx
This is a completely new file that adds the episode creation functionality.

### 2. Update: client/src/pages/home.tsx
- Import AddEpisodeModal
- Add state for episode modal and menu
- Replace single + button with floating menu
- Add both "Add Episode" and "Add Link" options

### 3. Update: client/src/components/add-link-modal.tsx
- Fix API call to use correct endpoint
- Update types to match schema

## What the updates do:
- Clicking + button now shows a menu with 2 options
- "Add Episode" lets you create new Rick and Morty episodes
- "Add Link" lets you add streaming links to existing episodes
- Perfect for starting with an empty database on Render

## Alternative: Direct Git Method
If the zip download isn't working, you can:
1. Connect this Replit to GitHub directly
2. Push the changes from here
3. Then deploy from GitHub to Render

Would you like me to help you set up the GitHub connection from Replit?
