### Your Files Are Ready Because:
✅ Frontend code is complete in the `client/` folder
✅ All components work (Rick and Morty theme, + button, search)
✅ Local storage handles all data (no backend needed)
✅ `netlify.toml` file is configured for deployment

## What Netlify Will Build:
- Your complete Rick and Morty streaming interface
- Floating + button for adding episode links
- Episode search and filtering
- All the portal effects and space theme
- Mobile responsive design

**Your site will be live at:** `https://your-chosen-name.netlify.app`

The build process happens on Netlify's servers, so you don't need to worry about building locally!
